Generate empirical probabilities for collisions across two bins

The classic birthday paradox configuration assumes balls are added to a single set of bins. In theory (so we thought), the likelihood of a collision is halved when the values are split across two sets of bins. The script generates random numbers and places them in bins, in an attempt to test this empirically.
